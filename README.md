# ChatbotwithOpenAI
AI chatbot built using OpenAI’s free API, developed in Google Colab with LangChain, Gradio, and Hugging Face for seamless interaction and NLP integration.

This is a mini project I developed during my 2nd semester—a simple yet powerful AI chatbot built using OpenAI’s free API. The chatbot leverages modern AI tools to deliver human-like conversations through natural language processing. I used Google Colab as the development platform for writing and executing the code. The core intelligence comes from OpenAI’s language model, integrated via API. To enhance functionality and flexibility, I utilized LangChain for chaining prompts and logic, while Gradio was used to build an interactive user interface without requiring frontend development skills. Hugging Face resources were also explored to understand and integrate additional NLP components. This project gave me hands-on experience in building conversational AI systems, API integration, and working with real-world machine learning tools.
